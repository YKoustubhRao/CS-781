This project is driven by my keen interest in understanding how historical trends play a crucial role in predicting daily stock performance. The performance of a stock on a given day is influenced not only by ongoing trends observed in the past but also by factors such as company changes, new policies, valuations, and other relevant developments for that specific day. Both company actions and historical trends contribute to the stock's performance during the trading day, particularly in terms of the difference between the closing and opening prices. Recognizing that the close-open difference may be influenced more by the current day's events rather than past trends, we also aim to forecast the difference between today's opening price and yesterday's closing price. This prediction is largely contingent on decisions made after the conclusion of the trading day. We anticipate that the insights generated by the abduction tools will assist us in identifying pivotal days from the past whose trends will significantly impact today's market trends.
For example the trends obtained during the budget day may have a strong say on the trends shown by a stock in the near future.

The analysis for the above problem is mainly motivated by the papers:
Abduction based Explanations for Machine Learning Models by Alexey Igantiev, Nina Narodytska, Joao Marques Silva, 2018
On Relating Explanations and Adversarial Examples by Alexey Igantiev, Nina Narodytska, Joao Marques Silva, 2019
which tries to find explanation sets on the data point for the behaviour of a machine learning architecture.
The tool presented on the following repo: https://github.com/alexeyignatiev/xreason, by the author will be used along the analysis.



To load the necessary data, Yahoo Finance's python module yfinance is used. The past data of around 100 firms from the finance sector is used to train the network.
At the moment, I have shortlisted the below 100 stocks from the US market data.

finance_symbols = [
    'HSBC', 'JPM', 'BAC', 'WFC', 'LYG', 'SPGI', 'MS', 'AXP', 'TD', 'GS', 'HDB', 'BCS', 'MUFG',
    'SCHW', 'MMC', 'BLK', 'PGR', 'CB', 'UBS', 'C', 'IBN', 'CME', 'BX', 'AON', 'SMFG',
    'ICE', 'MCO', 'SAN', 'ITUB', 'KKR', 'AJG', 'USB', 'BNS', 'PFH', 'BBVA', 'ING', 'APO', 
    'PNC', 'AFL', 'AIG', 'MET', 'BSBR', 'MFG', 'COF', 'TFC', 'TRV', 'BK', 'MFC', 'ALL', 'AMP',
    'BBD', 'PRU', 'ARES', 'CSGP', 'ACGL', 'PUK', 'NDAQ', 'NU', 'BBDO', 'SLF', 'HBANM', 'WTW', 
    'HBANP', 'DB', 'EFX', 'COIN', 'CBRE', 'HIG', 'IX', 'NWG', 'TW', 'TROW', 'DFS', 'RJF', 'STT',
    'BRO', 'FCNCA', 'CBOE', 'MTB', 'INVH', 'OWL', 'BEKE', 'ROL', 'MKL', 'WRB', 'LPLA', 'FITBI',
    'FITB', 'RYAN', 'EG', 'PFG', 'FITBP', 'ASBA', 'RKT', 'KB', 'CINF', 'VFS', 'SLMBP', 'HBAN', 'L'

To simplify the complexity of the data, I will be using only the past 50 days data for the analysis in the form of 5X10 images. To further simplify, the close - open trend 
alone is observed classifying the data point to a one on a profit and 0 on a loss or otherwise.
I will be training a CNN based model for the prediction, which I will be constructing using the pytorch module from Meta Research. I have to shortlist the actual set of
architectures I will be analyzing and then follow up by training the models themselves upto a good accuracy. Then the above tool is used to obtain a set of minimal set
explanation for the trend shown by a particular stock. We try to find if there is any real life correspondence with the relevance obtained from the tool.
